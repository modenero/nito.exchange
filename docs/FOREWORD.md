Upon entering the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) community in early January 2020, it quickly became apparent to me that privacy protocols were at the top of the priority list. CashShuffle had already been out for nearly a year, and CashFusion was on its way. I decided to focus on my own privacy application, __[Nito Cash](https://nito.cash)__, which would leverage one or both of these privacy protocols in a web-based wallet.

However, it quickly became apparent to me that I would have a problem with CashFusion, as its covert transmission mechanism was TOR, a protocol incompatible with web browsers. I also have doubts as the practicality of TOR when it comes to mobile devices, as in my experience it often leads to significant batter drain (something mobile users hate!), poor data reliability and security issues (namely the use of TOR itself).

> Nito Exchange is stop-gap on the way to a better mobile experience for mobile users looking to start leveraging CashShuffle and CashFusion.
