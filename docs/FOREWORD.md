# Foreword

> __Disclaimer:__ This is the opinion of Shomari Prince (nyusternie) and __DOES NOT__ represent the view of the greater Bitcoin Cash Please Foundation.

### Purpose

To offer an efficient mobile solution for Shuffling and Fusing Bitcoin Cash.

Due to the nature of the CashShuffle and CashFusion "blame" specifications; it would be problamatic to centralize a service to act as a proxy for mobile users.

Instead, our approach will be to create a pay-to-play scheme, whereby participants (players) will spend a nominal fee (eg. 1,000 satoshis) to participate in a single round of shuffling/fusing.

### Current Anonymity Protocols

I am especially fond of the cleverness in the specification for __[CashShuffle](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md)__, however __NOT__ so much with __[CashFusion.](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md)__

### Non-custodial

In an effort to remain compliant with AML/KYC policies; Nito Exchange will remain 100% non-custodial. In order to achieve this, participants will remain in complete control of their private keys throughout the shuffle/fusion process.

In order to avoid our cloud servers from being banned from CashShuffle and CashFusion servers, due to the efforts of malicious participants, we will utilize the "pay-to-play" feature of the Nito Exchange Server, which runs on an independent network built on IPFS Orbit DB.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

> According to a report by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a mere 10% of funds sent to mixers come from criminal activities, while the rest were mixed for personal privacy reasons.

Nito Cash Exchange is NOT a laundering service. Unlike dark market mixing services, ALL of our transaction are visible on-chain; meaning that law enforcement services such as Chainalysis and Amberdata WILL be able to ascertain, with a high probability, the source of coins in question.

__DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, AS IT IS NOT SAFE__

### Fees

1% of transaction amount, plus (estimated transaction) fees.

0.5% is returned at the end of the 7 shuffles OR 3 fuses.

0.5% is sent to Pay-It-Forward.

### Mobile vs Desktop

> In 2018, mobile phones generated 52.2% of worldwide website traffic. The expected mobile internet usage in 2019 is 80%.

As per global projections, an estimated 63.4% of global internet users will be accessing the web through their mobile devices in 2019.

China has a total of 802 million internet users, of which 98% use mobile devices. India is right behind having 502 million internet users, of which 80% use different forms of mobile device uses.

63% of online traffic in the US happens with smartphones

By 2020 e-commerce sales through mobile devices will touch 45% of total e-commerce sales in the US and will reach $284 billion. It shows a steep increase from 2014, where the contribution of mobile devices was only 11.6%.

Mobile market share worldwide is 52.1% compared to desktop market share of 44.2%.
