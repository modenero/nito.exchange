## Privacy for Cryptocurrency Wallets

In April 2018, a group of researchers published a 22-page __[research article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04299/)__ on Monero (XMR) blockchain.

Although Monero is currently one of the prominent privacy coins in the market (other prominent privacy coins include ZCash, Grin and Beam), the researchers were able to guess the wallet connected to Monero transactions with a whopping 80% accuracy rate.

Similarly, in November 2019, an article __[published](https://medium.com/dragonfly-research/breaking-mimblewimble-privacy-model-84bcd67bfe52)__ by Ivan Bogatyy of Dragonfly research has revealed that 96% could be unmasked from Grin transactions with a mere $60 spent on Amazon server space and negligible processing time, disproving the theory that MimbleWimble protocols are anonymous.

It is important to remember that the techniques deployed by these skilled researchers may not be easily replicated by regular users.

However, the existence of such flaws even in cryptocurrencies that claimed to be ‘Privacy-oriented Coins’ pose a greater concern to users, since anyone could engage skilled individuals to snoop out the ownership of any wallet addresses.

Fortunately, not all hope is lost in the battle against privacy rights in cryptocurrencies as privacy-focused wallets could act as a buffer between data infiltrators and users.
