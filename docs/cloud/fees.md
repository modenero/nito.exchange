# Fees

Nito Exchange has implemented a fee system that starts at FREE and goes up to 1%. This is primarily designed to protect your privacy by obfuscating the inputs and outputs of the various transactions conducted by the exchange.

> TL;DR â€” If and when the exchange is able to "safely" collect its fee(s), it is guaranteed never to exceed 1% of your total coin value.

1% of transaction amount, plus (estimated transaction) fees.

0.5% is returned at the end of the 7 shuffles OR 3 fuses.

0.5% is sent to Pay-It-Forward.

Estimating fiat USD value @ $250.00

> NOTE: Dust amount is 546 satoshis (~$0.001365)
