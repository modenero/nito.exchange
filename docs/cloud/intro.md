# Introduction

Nito Cash Cloud Exchange is a "centralized" service provided for the convenience of Nito Cash wallet users whom prefer NOT to operate their own private exchange server.

> NOTE: Nito Cloud aims to optimize your coins for better shuffling, by creating CashFusion outputs slightly above the pool tiers. By setting the output just 1,000 satoshis above the pool tier, it virtually

### Purpose

To offer an efficient mobile solution for Shuffling and Fusing Bitcoin Cash.

Due to the nature of the CashShuffle and CashFusion "blame" specifications; it would be problamatic to centralize a service to act as a proxy for mobile users.

Instead, our approach will be to create a pay-to-play scheme, whereby participants (players) will spend a nominal fee (eg. 1,000 satoshis) to participate in a single round of shuffling/fusing.

### Current Anonymity Protocols

I am especially fond of the cleverness in the specification for __[CashShuffle](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md)__, however __NOT__ so much with __[CashFusion.](https://github.com/cashshuffle/spec/blob/master/CASHFUSION.md)__

### Non-custodial

In an effort to remain compliant with AML/KYC policies; Nito Exchange will remain 100% non-custodial. In order to achieve this, participants will remain in complete control of their private keys throughout the shuffle/fusion process.

In order to avoid our cloud servers from being banned from CashShuffle and CashFusion servers, due to the efforts of malicious participants, we will utilize the "pay-to-play" feature of the Nito Exchange Server, which runs on an independent network built on IPFS Orbit DB.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

> According to a report by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, a mere 10% of funds sent to mixers come from criminal activities, while the rest were mixed for personal privacy reasons.

Nito Cash Exchange is NOT a laundering service. Unlike dark market mixing services, ALL of our transaction are visible on-chain; meaning that law enforcement services such as Chainalysis and Amberdata WILL be able to ascertain, with a high probability, the source of coins in question.

__DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, AS IT IS NOT SAFE__
