# Fee Rebates

User can supply a rebate account address to receive an SLP token (presumably Bai Cash).

> __NOTE:__ For security reasons, users __MUST provide a minimum of 3 _(up to 7)_ SLP account addresses;__ to facilitate randomizing the delivery of rebate rewards, spread across the users's accounts. For this reason, it can take __up to 24 hours__ to receive ALL rebate rewards, after completing a transaction.

During the first "promotional" months, rebates will be based on the __total balance__ of ALL supplied rebate account addresses.

100%+ of transaction value = 50% fee rebate.

90%+ of transaction value = 45% fee rebate.

80%+ of transaction value = 40% fee rebate.

70%+ of transaction value = 35% fee rebate.

60%+ of transaction value = 30% fee rebate.
