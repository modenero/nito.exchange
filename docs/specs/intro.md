# Introduction

Considering the popularity of privacy protocols like Monero and Dash, it's surprising that Bitcoin's own privacy protocol, __[CoinJoin](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/CoinJoin)__ (created by Gregory Maxwell), has been so under-utilized. However, for anyone who has actually tried to use this protocol, the answer is clear, it's NOT user-friendly.

__[CoinShuffle](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYKRAnBiVjkh5TPiLhbM7CmAX27cibZidn1SvxVGnsjAf)__ came along with an elegant decentralized protocol for constructing a joint transaction in such a way that no privacy is compromised; however, it too suffered from a lack of user-friendliness.

Alas, Bitcoin Cash developer Jonald Fyookball (lead developer for Electron Cash) solved the discovery and coordination problems of the past with CashShuffle.
